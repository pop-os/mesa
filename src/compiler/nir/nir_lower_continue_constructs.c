/* NIR pass to lower loop continue constructs.
 *
 * NIR loops are maintained in canonical form with these properties:
 *  - a pre-header: the only predecessor of the loop header
 *  - a dedicated exit node: dominated by the loop-header
 *  - a single back-edge to the loop header: the trivial continue
 *
 * If the loop has a continue construct, the trivial continue is the
 * back-edge from the last block of the continue construct to the loop
 * header. Otherwise, it is the back-edge from the last block of the
 * loop body to the loop header.
 *
 * In order to lower the continue construct of a loop, all continue
 * statements are being removed by either
 * - moving the following code to the other side of a branch or
 * - guarding following code by inserted IF-statements
 *
 * Afterwards, the continue construct is inlined before the trivial
 * back-edge.
